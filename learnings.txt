Multiple classes can be added to an element by listing them in the class attribute and separating them with a space.

color rgb-rules: primary colors

                 pure red 255
                 pure green 255
                 pure blue 255

                 secondary colors:

                 yellow = pure red + pure green
                 cyan = pure green + pure blue
                 magenta = pure red + pure blue

                 tertiary colors:

                 orange = pure red + green 127
                 spring green = pure green + blue 127
                 violet = red 127 + pure blue
                 chartreuse green = red 127 + pure green
                 azure = green 127 + pure blue
                 rose = pure red + blue 127

Complemantary colors standing next to each other can make text hard to read.

Choose a dominant color for a site and a complemantary color to draw attention to a certain spot on a site

The color stops in the linear-gradient function are 0%, 50% and 100% (in case of three colors) by default

The gradientDirection is 180deg by default (top to bottom)

DIV elements are block elements. When to block elements are next to each other then they'stack on each other. When we want them on the same line we have to change their display-property to inline-block.
